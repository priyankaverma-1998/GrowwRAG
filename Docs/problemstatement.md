# Problem Statement: Mutual Fund FAQ Assistant (Facts-Only Q&A)

## Overview

The objective of this project is to build a **facts-only FAQ assistant** for mutual fund schemes, using **Groww** as the reference product context. The assistant will answer objective, verifiable queries related to mutual funds by retrieving information exclusively from official public sources, such as AMC (Asset Management Company) websites, AMFI, and SEBI.

The system must **strictly avoid** providing investment advice, opinions, or recommendations. Every response must include a single, clear source link and adhere to defined constraints around clarity, accuracy, and compliance.

## Objective

- Answers factual queries about mutual fund schemes
- Uses a curated corpus of official documents
- Provides concise, source-backed responses

---

## Target Users

- **Retail investors** comparing mutual fund schemes
- **Customer support and content teams** handling repetitive mutual fund queries

### 2. FAQ Assistant Requirements

The assistant must:

- *"Which fund is better?"*

Refusal responses should:

- Be polite and clearly worded
- Reinforce the facts-only limitation
- Provide a relevant educational link (e.g., AMFI or SEBI resource)

---
